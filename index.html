            <h2>Free! Iwatobi Swim Club</h2>
            <p> Free! revolves around members of a high school boys' swimming team. Haruka Nanase, Makoto Tachibana, Rin
                Matsuoka and Nagisa Hazuki are members of the same swimming club in elementary school before parting
                ways, when Rin moves to Australia for schooling and specialized training in swimming. Years later, they
                reunite when Rin returns to Japan in order to attend Samezuka Academy, a swimming powerhouse.

                Haruka, Makoto, Nagisa form the Iwatobi High School Swim Club, persuading track athlete Rei Ryugazaki to
                become a swimmer and join them. The story focuses on how the Iwatobi boys seek to reconcile with a
                seemingly changed Rin while also developing the reinvented swim club. Things come to a head when Rin
                loses a prime spot on Samezuka's relay team during a crucial tournament and the Iwatobi team makes a
                critical decision that impacts one and all.
