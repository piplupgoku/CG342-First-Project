            <h2>Free!</h2>
            <p> Free is set in the town of Iwatobi, Japan, which is based on Iwami, Tottori.[3][4] The story is centered
                on high school student Haruka Nanase, a gifted swimmer. After encountering his childhood rival, Rin
                Matsuoka from Samezuka Academy, he and his friends revitalize Iwatobi High School's swim team. In
                addition to his childhood friends, Makoto Tachibana and Nagisa Hazuki, Rei Ryugazaki is recruited onto
                the team. While the team trains for tournaments, Haruka and Rin's rivalry continues to sour from Rin
                facing setbacks in improvement, though his desire to swim competitively escalates. However, during the
                prefectural tournament, Iwatobi's swim team reminds Rin of their friendship through a medley relay.
                Despite being disqualified, the boys' relationships with one another improve.

                In Free! Eternal Summer, Haruka, now in his final year in high school, has not decided on what to do
                after graduating. Meanwhile, Rin's childhood friend, Sosuke Yamazaki, transfers to Samezuka Academy. Rin
                hopes to swim competitively with Sosuke but, unbeknownst to him, Sosuke has injured his shoulder from
                overuse. During the regionals, Haruka becomes overwhelmed from the pressure of performing in front of
                scouts and becomes lost on what to do for the future. He further learns that his best friend, Makoto
                Tachibana, is leaving Iwatobi to attend university in Tokyo. Haruka withdraws from all social contact.
                However, with help from his friends and a trip to Sydney, Australia, where he visits the International
                Aquatic Centre, he decides to continue his swimming career and compete on the college level.

                In Free! Dive to the Future, Haruka attends Hidaka University and reconnects with his friends from
                junior high school, with the exception of Ikuya Kirishima, who is still bitter about their former team
                breaking up without explanation. In order to make amends with Ikuya, Haruka begins training in other
                strokes besides freestyle and eventually competes in an Individual Medley alongside him. Although they
                mend their friendship, Haruka is faced with the reality that he will be competing against swimmers at
                his level and higher. Despite this, he commits to continuing his swimming career and to competing on the
                global level.

                In Free! The Final Stroke (the first volume), Haruka, Rin, Ikuya and others make the Japan National Swim
                Team and compete at the global level in qualifying events and at the Fukuoka Tournament. In Free! The
                Final Stroke (the second volume), Haruka, Rin, Ikuya and Sosuke compete in a medley race and win gold
                medals, becoming national champions.

            <h2>Sk8 the Infinity</h2>
            <p>
                In Okinawa, a group of hardcore skaters participate in a secret, no-holds-barred competition after
                midnight known as "S", racing each other on skateboards down a winding road carved out of an abandoned
                mine and occasionally forming rivalries, also known as "beefs", with each other. Reki, a high school
                sophomore and hardcore skater, takes new transfer student Langa to S one night, and ends up pulling him
                into the world of skateboarding.
